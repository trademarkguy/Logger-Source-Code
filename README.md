Welcome to Logger source code.
This was made by fwtrademark on Discord & Instagram. 

Here's a step by step guide on how to run the bot:
1. Download the "Logger.zip" file and extract it. 
2. Head to the Discord Developer Portal and get your bot token.
3. Open the file "tokens.js" and replace *your token here* with your token.
4. Upload the new files to your chosen hosting platform and set the run file to "logger.js"

And that's it! if you have any questions / inquires message my Instagram as i'm not as active on Discord.
Wishing you best of luck with logging!
